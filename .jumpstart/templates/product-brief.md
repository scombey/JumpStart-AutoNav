## Scope Recommendation

### Must Have (MVP)

These capabilities are required to validate the problem is being solved. Each traces to a Phase 0 validation criterion.

| # | Capability | Validation Criterion Served | Rationale |
|---|-----------|---------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | [What the product must be able to do] | [Which criterion from Phase 0] | [Why this is essential for validation] |
| 2 | | | |
| 3 | | | |

### Should Have

These capabilities significantly improve the experience but are not required for initial validation.

| # | Capability | Rationale |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | [Capability description] | [Why it matters but can wait] |
| 2 | | |

### Could Have

Nice-to-have capabilities that can clearly wait for a later release.

| # | Capability | Rationale |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | [Capability description] | [Why it is lower priority] |
| 2 | | |

### Won't Have (This Release)

Capabilities explicitly excluded from this effort. Documenting these is as important as documenting what is included.

| # | Capability | Reason for Exclusion |
|---|-----------|---------------------|
| 1 | [Capability description] | [Why it is out of scope] |
| 2 | | |

### Constraints and Boundaries

Explicit boundary statements that define the scope limits for this project. These are validated by `bin/lib/boundary-check.js` against the implementation plan to prevent scope drift.

- [Boundary statement 1 — e.g., "This system will not handle payment processing"]
- [Boundary statement 2 — e.g., "No mobile app in this release"]
- [Boundary statement 3 — e.g., "Maximum 1,000 concurrent users for MVP"]

---

## Open Questions

### Resolved (from Phase 0)
- [Question from Phase 0]: [Resolution found during analysis]

### New Questions (for Phase 2)
- [Question raised during analysis that needs resolution before or during planning]

### Deferred
- [Question explicitly deferred]: [Rationale for deferral and when it should be revisited]

---

## Risks to the Product Concept

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| [Description of risk to the product concept, not technical risk] | High / Medium / Low | High / Medium / Low | [Proposed mitigation] |
| | | | |

## Technical Overview

[3-5 sentence summary of the system being built, the primary technical approach, and the key architectural characteristics (e.g., monolith vs. microservices, server-rendered vs. SPA, sync vs. async). This should give a developer joining the project enough context to understand the high-level picture.]

---

## Existing System Context (Brownfield Only)

> **Instruction:** Include this section only if `project.type` is `brownfield`. Remove it entirely for greenfield projects.

**Source:** [specs/codebase-context.md](codebase-context.md)

### Current Architecture Summary

[2-3 sentence summary of the existing system's architecture as documented by the Scout agent. Reference the C4 diagrams in the codebase context.]

### Constraints from Existing System

| Constraint | Rationale | Impact on New Design |
|------------|-----------|---------------------|
| [e.g., Must maintain PostgreSQL 14] | [Why this can't change] | [How this shapes the new architecture] |
| [e.g., Existing REST API contracts] | [External consumers depend on them] | [Must maintain backward compatibility] |

### Migration Strategy

[Brief description of how the new architecture will coexist with or transition from the existing system. Reference any relevant ADRs.]

---

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Choice | Version | Justification | Alternatives Considered |
|-------|--------|---------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Language** | [e.g., TypeScript] | [e.g., 5.x] | [Why this fits the requirements] | [What else was evaluated and why rejected] |
| **Runtime** | [e.g., Node.js] | [e.g., 20 LTS] | | |
| **Framework** | [e.g., Next.js] | [e.g., 14.x] | | |
| **Database** | [e.g., PostgreSQL] | [e.g., 16] | | |
| **ORM / Query** | [e.g., Prisma] | | | |
| **Authentication** | [e.g., NextAuth.js] | | | |
| **Testing** | [e.g., Vitest + Playwright] | | | |
| **Linting** | [e.g., ESLint + Prettier] | | | |
| **Hosting** | [e.g., Vercel] | | | |
| **CI/CD** | [e.g., GitHub Actions] | | | |

[Add or remove rows as appropriate for the project. Not every project needs every layer.]

---

## System Components

### Component: [Name]

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Responsibility** | [What this component does, 2-3 sentences] |
| **Depends On** | [Other components this one calls or consumes from] |
| **Exposes** | [Interfaces: API endpoints, events, exported functions] |
| **Key Stories** | [PRD story IDs this component implements] |
| **Key Files** | [Primary file paths for this component] |

### Component: [Name]

[Repeat for each component]

## Component Interaction Diagram

```mermaid
C4Component
    title Component Interaction — [System Name]

    %% Replace with actual components from Step 3: System Component Design
    Container_Boundary(system, "System") {
        Component(gateway, "API Gateway", "Framework", "Request routing and rate limiting")
        Component(auth, "Auth Service", "Service", "Authentication and authorization")
        Component(core, "Core Service", "Service", "Primary business logic")
        Component(notif, "Notification Service", "Service", "Email and push notifications")
    }

    ContainerDb(db, "Database", "Engine", "Persistent storage")
    ContainerDb(cache, "Cache", "Redis", "Session and query cache")
    System_Ext(extApi, "External API", "Third-party integration")

    Rel(gateway, auth, "Authenticates via")
    Rel(gateway, core, "Routes requests to")
    Rel(core, db, "Reads/writes", "SQL")
    Rel(core, cache, "Caches queries", "Redis Protocol")
    Rel(core, extApi, "Fetches data from", "REST/HTTPS")
    Rel(core, notif, "Triggers notifications")
    Rel(auth, cache, "Stores sessions", "Redis Protocol")

    UpdateLayoutConfig($c4ShapeInRow="3", $c4BoundaryInRow="1")
```

[Replace with the actual component interaction diagram from Step 3. Use `C4Component` for Mermaid C4 syntax if `diagram_format` is `mermaid`, or provide an ASCII/text-based representation otherwise.]

---

## Data Model

### Entity: [Name]

**Description:** [What this entity represents in the domain]

| Field | Type | Constraints | Default | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| `id` | UUID / SERIAL / etc. | PK | auto-generated | Unique identifier |
| `[field_name]` | [type] | [NOT NULL, UNIQUE, FK -> Table.field, etc.] | [default or none] | [What this field stores] |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | NOT NULL | NOW() | Record creation time |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMP | NOT NULL | NOW() | Last modification time |

**Indexes:**
- `idx_[entity]_[field]` on `[field]` -- [justification, e.g., "Supports lookup by email for authentication"]

### Entity: [Name]

[Repeat for each entity]

---

### Entity Relationship Diagram

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USER {
        uuid id PK
        string email UK "NOT NULL"
        string name "NOT NULL"
        string password_hash "NOT NULL"
        timestamp created_at "NOT NULL"
        timestamp updated_at "NOT NULL"
    }
    PROJECT {
        uuid id PK
        uuid owner_id FK "NOT NULL"
        string title "NOT NULL"
        text description
        enum status "NOT NULL"
        timestamp created_at "NOT NULL"
    }
    TASK {
        uuid id PK
        uuid project_id FK "NOT NULL"
        uuid assignee_id FK
        string title "NOT NULL"
        text description
        enum priority "NOT NULL"
        enum status "NOT NULL"
        timestamp due_date
        timestamp created_at "NOT NULL"
    }

    USER ||--o{ PROJECT : "owns"
    USER ||--o{ TASK : "assigned to"
    PROJECT ||--o{ TASK : "contains"
```

[Replace with actual ERD. Include field definitions with types, constraints, and keys for each entity. Use Mermaid's `erDiagram` with field blocks for detailed models.]

### Relationship Details

| Relationship | Type | Implementation | Cascade on Delete |
|-------------|------|----------------|-------------------|
| [Entity A] to [Entity B] | One-to-Many | FK `entity_a_id` on Entity B | [CASCADE / SET NULL / RESTRICT] |
| | | | |

## Infrastructure and Deployment

### Deployment Strategy

[How the application is deployed: static hosting, containers, serverless, traditional server, PaaS. Include specific service names where applicable.]

### Environment Strategy

| Environment | Purpose | URL Pattern | Data | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------------|------|-------|
| Local | Development | `localhost:[port]` | Seed data / local DB | |
| Staging | Pre-production testing | [URL or pattern] | [Copy of production / synthetic] | |
| Production | Live users | [URL or pattern] | Real data | |

### CI/CD Pipeline

```
Push to branch
  -> Lint
  -> Type check (if applicable)
  -> Unit tests
  -> Integration tests
  -> Build
  -> [Staging deploy on main branch]
  -> [Production deploy on release tag / manual trigger]
```

[Customise the pipeline to match the project's needs.]

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required | Example | Secret? |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | [Database connection string] | Yes | `postgresql://...` | Yes |
| `[VAR_NAME]` | [Description] | Yes / No | [Example value] | Yes / No |

> All required variables should be listed in `.env.example` with placeholder values. Actual secrets must never be committed to the repository.

### Scaling Considerations

[How the system handles increased load. Only include this section if the NFRs specify throughput or concurrency targets. For simple applications, a single sentence like "The application runs as a single instance; scaling is not a concern for the MVP" is sufficient.]

## Security Architecture

### Trust Boundaries

```
[Diagram or description of trust boundaries in the system]
[Client] --HTTPS--> [API Gateway] --Internal--> [Services] --Encrypted--> [Database]
         ^                        ^                         ^
    Trust Boundary 1         Trust Boundary 2          Trust Boundary 3
```

### Data Protection

| Data Asset | Sensitivity | At Rest | In Transit | Access Control |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-----------|---------------|
| [e.g., User PII] | Critical | [Encryption method] | TLS 1.3 | [RBAC / ABAC] |
| [e.g., Session tokens] | High | [Storage method] | TLS 1.3 | [HttpOnly cookies] |

### Authentication and Authorisation

| Concern | Approach | Implementation |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| User authentication | [e.g., OAuth 2.0 / JWT / Session] | [Component responsible] |
| Service-to-service auth | [e.g., mTLS / API keys / IAM] | [Component responsible] |
| Authorisation model | [e.g., RBAC / ABAC / ACL] | [Component responsible] |

### OWASP Top 10 Considerations

| Risk | Mitigation in Architecture | Component |
|------|---------------------------|-----------|
| A01: Broken Access Control | [e.g., Middleware auth checks on all routes] | [Component] |
| A02: Cryptographic Failures | [e.g., AES-256 at rest, TLS in transit] | [Component] |
| A03: Injection | [e.g., Parameterised queries via ORM] | [Component] |

> **Note:** For a comprehensive security review, invoke the Security Architect agent (`/jumpstart.security`) after Phase 3 approval. This section captures security decisions made during architecture design; the Security Review provides a full threat model and OWASP audit.

---

## Directory AGENTS.md Plan (Greenfield Only)

> **Instruction:** Include this section only if `project.type` is `greenfield`. Remove it entirely for brownfield projects. The Developer agent will create these files during scaffolding and maintain them during task execution. Use the template from `.jumpstart/templates/agents-md.md`.

| Directory | Purpose | Key Exports | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------------|-------|
| `src/` | Application root | — | Top-level module documentation |
| [e.g., `src/api/`] | [API endpoint handlers] | [Routes, middleware] | |
| [e.g., `src/models/`] | [Data models and schemas] | [Entity types, validators] | |
| [e.g., `src/services/`] | [Business logic layer] | [Service functions] | |

[Add rows for each directory that should receive an AGENTS.md file. The depth is governed by `agents.developer.agents_md_depth` in config.yaml: `top-level` (src/ only), `module` (src/[module]/), or `deep` (all significant directories).]

# Jump Start -- Slash Command Definitions

This file defines the slash commands that drive the Jump Start workflow. Each command activates a specific agent or system function. These definitions are consumed by the AI assistant integration layer to route commands to the correct agent persona and instructions.

**Agent:** The Diagram Verifier
**Agent File:** `.jumpstart/agents/diagram-verifier.md`
**Output:** Verification report (displayed, not written to file)

**Description:** Validate all Mermaid diagrams in specification artifacts for structural syntax correctness and semantic accuracy. Runs both the automated CLI syntax checker and AI-powered semantic validation. Can be invoked manually at any time or is triggered automatically at phase gates for Scout and Architect when `diagram_verification.auto_verify_at_gate` is `true`.

**Usage:**
```
/jumpstart.verify
/jumpstart.verify specs/architecture.md
```

**CLI equivalent:**
```
npx jumpstart-mode verify
npx jumpstart-mode verify --file specs/architecture.md --strict
```

**Pre-conditions:**
- `diagram_verification.enabled` must be `true` in `.jumpstart/config.yaml` (default: `true`).

6. For each error or warning, suggest a specific fix with corrected Mermaid code.

**Guardrails:**
- The verifier does not modify any files. It reports findings only.
- The responsible agent (Scout or Architect) or the human applies fixes.
- When `strict_c4_semantics` is `true`, C4 level consistency violations are treated as errors.

The Facilitator agent discovers all available agent personas by scanning `.jumpstart/agents/`, selects the most relevant 2-3 agents for the current topic, and orchestrates an in-character discussion. Party Mode is advisory: it surfaces insights and perspectives but does not write or modify any spec artifacts.

**Usage:**
```
/jumpstart.party [optional: topic or question]
```

**Pre-conditions:** None. Party Mode can be invoked at any point in the workflow.

**Behavior:**
1. Load the Facilitator agent persona from `.jumpstart/agents/facilitator.md`.
2. Scan `.jumpstart/agents/*.md` to discover available agent personas.
3. If a topic is provided, select the 2-3 most relevant agents for that topic.
4. If no topic is provided, ask the human what they would like to discuss.
5. Orchestrate a roundtable discussion with agents responding in-character.
6. The Facilitator moderates: keeps discussion on-topic, resolves conflicts, and summarises key points.
7. At session end, present a summary of insights, agreements, and open questions.
8. The human decides what (if anything) to incorporate into formal artifacts.

**Guardrails:**
- No agent may write to any file in `specs/` during Party Mode.
- All agents must respect the Roadmap (`.jumpstart/roadmap.md`).
- The Facilitator stays neutral and does not advocate for any position.

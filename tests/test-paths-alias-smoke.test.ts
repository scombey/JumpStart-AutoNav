/**
 * test-paths-alias-smoke.test.ts — T1.1 acceptance gate.
 *
 * Asserts that the tsconfig `paths` alias `@lib/*` resolves correctly during
 * the strangler phase at BOTH layers:
 *
 *   1. tsc typecheck: tsconfig.json `paths` maps `@lib/*` to
 *      `src/lib/*` (preferred) then `bin/lib/*` (legacy). The import
 *      below would fail `tsc --noEmit` if the alias were misconfigured.
 *   2. Vitest runtime: vitest.config.js `resolve.alias` mirrors the
 *      tsconfig mapping so tests exercise the same resolution. Without
 *      it this import would throw at runtime even though tsc was happy.
 *
 * Real per-module testing happens in tests/test-<name>.test.{js,ts};
 * this is intentionally minimal — the alias and strict mode only.
 *
 * @see specs/decisions/adr-005-module-layout.md
 * @see specs/implementation-plan.md T1.1
